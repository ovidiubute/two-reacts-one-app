# two-reacts-one-app
Test if you can have two different versions of React within a single web app. I used the latest stable versions of React 14 and 15. 
I think this is the first time that you can load two React versions without having problems. There is one condition though: never mix components rendered with different Reacts within the same DOM tree.
